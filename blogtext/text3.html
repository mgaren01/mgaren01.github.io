            <h2>Week Three</h2>
            <br>
            <p>So this week started out maybe more stressful than the first. Not sure
                if it was something in the water or what, but from the end of last week,
                it seemed as though any confidence had gone straight out of me. <br>
                Thankfully, I was able to learn (all over again) that asking for help is
                my best weapon through this process. I think that maybe my biggest
                challenge is that I'm no longer used to pursuing things past the point of
                being bad at them, and what I've experienced are the growing pains of
                growing into that role of student again. Whatever things I've learned in
                the last few years have mostly been simple and easy to get used to. Hard
                things, as I'm relearning, are hard.<br>
                The hard work is slowly starting to pay off, too. While it's still true
                that I don't necessarily grasp everything on the first, or even second,
                attempt, I do grasp more now than I did at the beginning, and I think I'm
                starting to become used to the idea of experimenting around to find a workable
                solution to my coding problems. Still, must always remind myself to seek
                help when I'm driving myself mad. For this week, there are some who certainly
                have earned a shout-out for their invaluable assistance (they know who they are!).<br>
                So again I find myself in the position of saying that, having wanted to quit,
                I'm once more glad that I did not. And not to sound too egomaniacal, but I'm
                now looking forward to seeing what I can overcome next.
