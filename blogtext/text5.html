        <h2>Week Five (Full-Time Week One)</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The setting makes the difference. I know I've already said it, but the
            whole work-from-home deal was just not doing it for me. Actually being
            in the office, and now actually having a bunch of people around as well,
            is a game-changer. And as I get more comfortable with everyone, everything
            else seems to be flowing that much smoother.<br>
            That's not to say things haven't still been challenging, because they have.
            The weight of the challenge, however, is slowly becoming subsumed by the
            enjoyment of figuring something out and applying it. Case in point: this week's
            projects provided a nice mix of creative and logical challenges that overlapped
            well, and the local network of support made solving the various problems that
            arose a deal less arduous. Though it was always clear that I should reach out
            for help if I needed it, I didn't always feel right about seeking guidance.<br>
            Weirdly, being in-person seems to have taken the ego out of it for me. Id've
            thought the reverse. <br>
            I can't go without mentioning the session in the park with Dr. Luke, which was
            a very positive experience. Having the words to describe my goals in showing
            up every day makes the hard parts a little easier to put up with. Rather than
            laboring in the service of some vague potential that's "over there," I now have
            something more solid to latch onto. <br>
            I think that about does it for now. I'm looking forward to converting this blog
            over to bootstrap, and generally getting my hands dirty elsewhere. <br>
            Until next time.
