        <h2>Week Four</h2>
        <br>
        <p>This has been a much better week. After a rocky start on Monday,
            I rediscovered the benefits of actually being on-site, and the
            immediacy of assistance. It's probably not exaggerating by much
            at all to suggest that I may not have completed my projects this
            week if I had not left the house. Thankfully, it seems to be finally
            sinking in for me that help is not only available, but is desirable
            to seek out.<br>
            Now that my work and support habits/needs are more in order, it's a
            deal easier to have a little fun. I still find javascript to be a
            bit of a pain, but I suppose that's to be expected when learning
            a new language in tandem with a new way to structure one's
            thinking. It being a pain does not, however, suggest that I'm not
            starting to get it; while, starting out, it was easy enough to
            identify an individual expression, now it's getting easier to identify
            what the expression is <em>saying</em>. And not to beat a dead horse,
            but I would probably not be where I am without help (which I reiterate
            mostly for my own benefit). <br>
            I'm happy to say that I have very few misgivings about going forward
            into full-time. I eagerly anticipate a larger one-to-one environment,
            with lots of people to bounce ideas off of and generally collaborate
            with. <br>
            See you next week!
