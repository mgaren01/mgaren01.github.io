    <h1>Mike's Truly, Terribly, Hyperbolically Awful Blog! (Title Pending)</h1>
    <h2>A Work In Progress</h2>

    <h2>Week One</h2>
    <h3>The struggle, as they say, is real.  If I had to characterize my 
        experience in one word, it would be "stressful."  I didn't know
        what to expect, and generally try to avoid expectations in favor of
        anticipation, but I was nonetheless thrown somewhat for a loop.
        That's not necessarily a bad thing, though.  It means I've learned 
        the reality of what I'm in for, which means I can now set my
        expectations accordingly.  And this page should be evidence enough
        that I managed to grasp some programming basics as well. 
        The introductory materials did not disappoint in what they predicted.
        I did want to quit, a couple different times.  But now I'm glad I didn't.
        The material wasn't as hard as I'd convinced myself it was.  And 
        though my page will be far from complete, or even "nice" for that 
        matter, for demo, it is at least a beginning, and I am happy 
        enough with that for now.  
        They say the scariest thing for artists and writers is a blank page.
        I think the same thing is true for programming.  Having now put pen 
        to paper, if you will, the hardest part is done.  I look forward to
        learning more, the better to build on this beginning.
