    <h2>Sharing My Thoughts, Whether You Want To Hear Them Or Not!</h2>

    <h2>Week One</h2>
    <h3>The struggle, as they say, is real.  And as the introductory materials
        promised, I did indeed encounter deep feelings of discomfort.  A few 
        days ago, I might have come off as a deal more cocky about how this
        whole process was going to go for me.  I don't feel that way now, 
        that's for sure.
        But that's a good thing.  It means I've learned the reality of what
        it's going to take to get through.  And it also means I've learned 
        enough that I can reasonably expect someone to see this message
        on teh inturnetz.  
        Put in briefer terms, my biggest struggle this week has been against
        my own foibles.  Oh, and the abstractness of much of the material.
        Can't forget that.
        So no, the experience hasn't been quite what I expected, but it didn't 
        break me either.  And now that I'm here, I'm very much looking 
        forward to exploring the logical side of things with pseudo-coding, 
        which I think may help things flow a little smoother in future.
