        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p>The struggle, as they say, is real.  If I had to characterize my 
            experience in one word, it would be "stressful."  I didn't know
            what to expect, and generally try to avoid expectations in favor of
            anticipation, but I was nonetheless thrown somewhat for a loop.<br>
            That's not necessarily a bad thing, though.  It means I've learned 
            the reality of what I'm in for, which means I can now set my
            expectations accordingly.  And this page should be evidence enough
            that I managed to grasp some programming basics as well.<br> 
            The introductory materials did not disappoint in what they predicted.
            I did want to quit, a couple different times.  But now I'm glad I didn't.
            The material wasn't as hard as I'd convinced myself it was.  And 
            though my page will be far from complete, or even "nice" for that 
            matter, for demo, it is at least a beginning, and I am happy 
            enough with that for now.<br>  
            They say the scariest thing for artists and writers is a blank page.
            I think the same thing is true for programming.  Having now put pen 
            to paper, if you will, the hardest part is done.  I look forward to
            learning more, the better to build on this beginning.
        </p>

        <h2>Week Two</h2>
        <p>In general, the second week has, for me, gone more smoothly than 
            the first.  Somehow, I felt like I had more time to do what I 
            needed to do.  That's not to say it was without stress, but I 
            suppose that's fairly normal when learning and applying new
            things.<br>
            The excercise in Pseudocoding proved to be an interesting one.
            It is a part of the practice of programming that I never knew
            existed until just recently, though in retrospect it makes a 
            lot of sense that one would try to break up a problem into 
            component parts.  I was happy to discover that this logical
            excercise played to my strengths as a philosophy student, and 
            thereby did not throw me off much at all.  It was still a challenge,
            certainly, but one which I was equipped in advance to handle.<br>
            Though it did help that I got to pick my project.  I always enjoy that.<br>
            As before, I remain interested to see how new materials
            will allow us to build on what's already been done.
        </p>

        <h2>Week Three</h2>
        <p>So this week started out maybe more stressful than the first.  Not sure 
            if it was something in the water or what, but from the end of last week,
            it seemed as though any confidence had gone straight out of me. <br>
            Thankfully, I was able to learn (all over again) that asking for help is
            my best weapon through this process.  I think that maybe my biggest 
            challenge is that I'm no longer used to pursuing things past the point of
            being bad at them, and what I've experienced are the growing pains of
            growing into that role of student again.  Whatever things I've learned in 
            the last few years have mostly been simple and easy to get used to.  Hard 
            things, as I'm relearning, are hard.<br>
            The hard work is slowly starting to pay off, too.  While it's still true
            that I don't necessarily grasp everything on the first, or even second, 
            attempt, I do grasp more now than I did at the beginning, and I think I'm 
            starting to become used to the idea of experimenting around to find a workable
            solution to my coding problems.  Still, must always remind myself to seek 
            help when I'm driving myself mad.  For this week, there are some who certainly
            have earned a shout-out for their invaluable assistance (they know who they are!).<br>
            So again I find myself in the position of saying that, having wanted to quit,
            I'm once more glad that I did not.  And not to sound too egomaniacal, but I'm 
            now looking forward to seeing what I can overcome next.
        </p>

        <h2>Week Four</h2>
        <p>This has been a much better week.  After a rocky start on Monday,
            I rediscovered the benefits of actually being on-site, and the 
            immediacy of assistance.  It's probably not exaggerating by much
            at all to suggest that I may not have completed my projects this 
            week if I had not left the house.  Thankfully, it seems to be finally
            sinking in for me that help is not only available, but is desirable 
            to seek out.<br>
            Now that my work and support habits/needs are more in order, it's a
            deal easier to have a little fun.  I still find javascript to be a 
            bit of a pain, but I suppose that's to be expected when learning 
            a new language in tandem with a new way to structure one's 
            thinking.  It being a pain does not, however, suggest that I'm not 
            starting to get it; while, starting out, it was easy enough to 
            identify an individual expression, now it's getting easier to identify
            what the expression is <em>saying</em>.  And not to beat a dead horse,
            but I would probably not be where I am without help (which I reiterate
            mostly for my own benefit).  <br>
            I'm happy to say that I have very few misgivings about going forward 
            into full-time.  I eagerly anticipate a larger one-to-one environment, 
            with lots of people to bounce ideas off of and generally collaborate
            with.  <br>   
            See you next week!
        </p>

        <h2>Week Five (Full-Time Week One)</h2>
        <p>The setting makes the difference.  I know I've already said it, but the 
            whole work-from-home deal was just not doing it for me.  Actually being 
            in the office, and now actually having a bunch of people around as well, 
            is a game-changer.  And as I get more comfortable with everyone, everything 
            else seems to be flowing that much smoother.<br>
            That's not to say things haven't still been challenging, because they have.
            The weight of the challenge, however, is slowly becoming subsumed by the
            enjoyment of figuring something out and applying it.  Case in point: this week's 
            projects provided a nice mix of creative and logical challenges that overlapped
            well, and the local network of support made solving the various problems that 
            arose a deal less arduous.  Though it was always clear that I should reach out 
            for help if I needed it, I didn't always feel right about seeking guidance.<br>
            Weirdly, being in-person seems to have taken the ego out of it for me.  Id've 
            thought the reverse.  <br>
            I can't go without mentioning the session in the park with Dr. Luke, which was 
            a very positive experience.  Having the words to describe my goals in showing 
            up every day makes the hard parts a little easier to put up with.  Rather than 
            laboring in the service of some vague potential that's "over there," I now have
            something more solid to latch onto.  <br>
            I think that about does it for now.  I'm looking forward to converting this blog
            over to bootstrap, and generally getting my hands dirty elsewhere. <br>
            Until next time.
